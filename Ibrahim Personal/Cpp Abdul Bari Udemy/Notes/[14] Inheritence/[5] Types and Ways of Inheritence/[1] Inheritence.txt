Types of Inheritence:

1. Simple/ Single Inheritence
2. Hierarchical Inheritence
3. MultiLevel Inheritence
4. Multiple Inheritence
5. Hybrid Inheritence - Mixture if two inheritence


- Multipath Inheritence: The features of base class A will be available in D via B and C.
- Here the ambiguity is that the function D should get features of A via B or C ??
- To remove this ambiguity virtual base class is used. If we write VIRTUAL for class B and D then there will be no ambiguity.

- Virtual base class is used to remove the ambiguity of the derived class from the parent class which are coming through
multiple classes.
