There are three types of errors which can occur in the programming:

1. Syntax Error - Compiler can resolve it, programmer is responsible
2. Logical Error - Debugger can help with it, programmer is responsible
3. Runtime Error - Programmers can help giving a warning, user is responsible

There are some cause of error during runtime.

1. Bad Input:- eg integer needed but string given
2. Lack of resources:- lack of files, printer, lack of ink, etc

Runtime error is called as Exception. Programmer must give warnings to the user for not facing runtime error.
e.g if there is low fuel in a car or air pressure, warning will be given.


C++ Compiler does not have capability to throw the exception like java. Hence programmer has to throw the error themselves

// Note here that for throw int in this code, value of int does not have meaning but it can be used to show error
code to the user informing the user which type of error it is.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x=10, z;
    //int y=2, // Try changing the value of y and executing the program again to see the difference
    int y=0;

    try
    {
        if (y==0)
            throw 1; // Note that this is like if else statement if condition is met int will be thrown
        z = x/y;
        cout << z << endl;
    }

    catch (int e) // here we have written int because we are throwing an integer
    {
        cout << "Division by zero " << e << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program Ended" << endl; // This will always be executed

    return 0;
}
