int A[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}

int *p = A; here lets say 1 is stored in mem location 200/201
// then p strores 200

There are five operations allowed on pointers.

1. p++ 

- This means that p will now contain address 202 and not 201
- The value of the pointer incremented depends on the datatype of the pointer
- If the datatype is float then the pointer will be incremented by +4
- If it is char the pointer will be incremented by +1.

2. p--

- Same as how p++ works

3. p = p + 2;

- if pointer is pointing at 202 then now it will point at 206.

4. p = p - 2;

- same as p + 2

5. d = q - p; // distance between two pointers or the number of elements between 2 pointers

consider this 

int A[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}

int *p = A;
int *q = &A[3]

hence q-p here will give 206-200 = 6 and 6/2(as datatype is int) = 3
- meaning there are 3 elements between pointers p and q

6. d = p-q;

- here the answer will be 200-206 = -6 
- hence this tells us which pointer is far away 
- In this example it means that q is far away as the difference is negative and v.v. for positive difference.
