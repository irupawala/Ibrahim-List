* Consider the two examples. 

1. Cuboid Inherited from rectangle. OR fortuna inherited from Innova

2. Rectangle, circle, quadrilateral have a generalized term SHAPE. Shape is a virtual term which does not acually exist.

- Here 2. is generalization where the child classes already exists but to bring them to a common platform we have given a name shape.
We can calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle, circle but not of shape but shape has those functions it just can't be calculated 
because shape does not have dimensions.

Hence there are two types of Inheritence.

1. Parent was existing and child was defined later hence child borrowed the features from parents. This is specialization.
Purpose here is to give something to child class.

2. Child classes were existing and then we defined the base class. This is generalization.
Purpose here is to group the child classes together. Hence purpose of Generalizrion is nothing but POLYMORPHISM.
