- Class is deterined by Classification. Class share specific common properties.
- Eg. Car is class. Camry, Civic are the objects.
- Class is a definiation. Object is an instance.
- Design of a room (blueprint) is a class and the actual rooms made 
with the help of that class are objects.
- Design of a chip is class while actual chips made out of it are objects.

- Class in programming consists of two things data and fuctions.
- Data is called as properties and function is called behavior

e.g.

Class Rectangle
{

	float lenght; // data
	float breadth; // data
	
	float area(); // function
	float perimeter(); // function
	float diagonal(); // function
	};
	
Now objects of the classes are say r1, r2, r3, etc

- These objects will have all the functions like area
