There are two methods of writing functions inside the class. These functions are called member functions.

class rectangle
{

private:

int length;
int breadth;

public:

int area() // This is one way of writing the function inside the class

{
return length*breadth;
}

int perimeter(); // This is another way where you just write the function name inside the class

};


int rectangle:: perimeter() // return type nameoftheclass :: nameOfFunction
{
return 2*(length+breadth);
}


void main()
{

rectangle r(10,5);
cout << r.area();
cout<<r.perimeter();
}

*** DIFFERNCE BETWEEN TWO METHODS OF WRITING MEMBERS FUNCTIONS

* When the function is written inside the class then in the machine code that function is created inside 
the main function where it is called. Such kind of functions are called as INLINE Functions. Eg. area() function above.

* When the function is written outside the class like the perimeter function here using 
the SCOPE RESOLUTION OPERATOR then the machine code for the function will be SEPARATELY GENERATED.
When these functions are called in the main function then it will go to these functions and return to main
after the functions has been executed.

** IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE IN C++ TO WRITE THE FUNCTION OUTSIDE THE CLASS
