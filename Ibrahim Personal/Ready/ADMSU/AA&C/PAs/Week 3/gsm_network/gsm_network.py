The Problem of Graph Coloring is NP_Complete hence to solve it we need SAT Solver.
To find the satisfying assignment for this scenario we need to fed the following clauses to SAT Solver 

1. Exactly one is True: 
    
for each vertex ùëñ of the initial graph and each possible color ùëó , 1 ‚â§ ùëó ‚â§ 3 
which means ‚Äúvertex ùëñ has color ùëó ‚Äù. Think how to write down conditions like ‚Äúeach vertex has to be coloredby some color‚Äù

This is achieved by the formula (‚Ñì1 ‚à® ‚Ñì2 ‚à® ‚Ñì3) (-‚Ñì1 ‚à® -‚Ñì2) (-‚Ñì1 ‚à® -‚Ñì3) (-‚Ñì2 ‚à® -‚Ñì3)

2. Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors 

This is acheived by the formula (-‚Ñì1 ‚à® -‚Ñì2), meaning both the literals cannot be true together

#    for pair in itertools.product(literals, repeat=2): # then for all pair of literals we add a clause containing two negated literals from this list    
    for pair in itertools.combinations(literals, 2):
