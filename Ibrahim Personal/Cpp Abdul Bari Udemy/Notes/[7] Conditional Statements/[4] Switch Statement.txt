- switch is a branch and control statement.
- switch is faster then if-else because unlike if-else it doesn't check all the conditions
- switch(exp) --> note that this exp can be char or int
- note that in the statement case 1: there is a space between case and 1. It will generate wrong results if you don't give this space


switch(exp)
{
case 1:
---
break;

case 2:
---
break;

default:
---
}

- default is optional. it won't throw an error if you don't include default. 
- If you give any value in the expression for which there is no case then the default will be executed.
- default can also be written anywhere in the program but if not in end then the break statement has to be included with it.
- Every case block must terminate with break. 
- If you don't mention break after any case then it will execute that case and the case after that untill the break statement is reached.
This is called fall through in programming.
- If int tyoe then cases can be 0,1,2.... If the char type then we have char labels like 'a', 'b', 'c'..... but cases names cannot be STRINGS.


* Nested Switch:

- switch statment inside a switch statment.

- Switch is used for menu-driven programs like file option in notepad will have New, Save, Saveas, etc
