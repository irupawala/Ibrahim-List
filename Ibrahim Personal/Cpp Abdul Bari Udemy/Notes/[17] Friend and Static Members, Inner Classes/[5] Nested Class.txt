- Nested Class/ Inner Class is writing a class within another class so that it can be used ONLY within that class.
- This is to reduce the compexity of the big classes.
- 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class outer
{

public:
    int a=10;
    static int b;
    void fun()
    {


    }

    class inner_product{
public:
    int x=25;
    void show()
    cout << "show";

    };
};

int outer::b=20;


- Here note that inner class CANNOT ACCESS ANY MEMBERS OF THE INNER CLASS BUT ONLY STATIC MEMBERS
- Also Outer Class can create an object of the inner class and access all the members of the inner class which are declared as public
