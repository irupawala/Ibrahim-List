- Namespaces are used for removing name conflicts
- If we require the functions or classes with the same name or signature or prototype then there will 
be name conflicts
- Ibrahim: NAMESPACE ARE USED TO STRUCTURE A PROGRAM INTO LOGICAL UNITS

e.g.

void fun()
{
cout << "First";
}

void fun()
{
cout << "Second";
}

int main()
{
fun();
}

// here the compiler will not compile the program at the first place because name conflict will happen.
- Using the namespace we can encapuslate the function inside the namespace and then we can call the functions
separately using the scope resolution operator.

namespace First
{					// these brackets are mandatory
	void fun()
	{
	cout << "First";
	}
}

namespace Second
{
	void fun()
		{
		cout << "Second";
		}

}

int main()
{
First::fun();
}

- Also note that in one namespace we can have many other things like all the related classes, functions
and objects

Also If we want to avoid using scope resolution operator all the time we can write **using namespace std**

using namespace first; // RECOMMENDED TO AVOID THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS
int main()
{
fun();			// if you don't mention anything fun of first will be called
second::fun();  // if you explicitly mention nsmaspace using scope resolution operator then second will be called
}


** NOW WE CAN UNDERTAND THAT INSTEAD OF NAMESPACE STD DECLARATION IN EVERY PROGRAM WE CAN ALSO WRITE

std::cout<<"kkk"<< endl;
