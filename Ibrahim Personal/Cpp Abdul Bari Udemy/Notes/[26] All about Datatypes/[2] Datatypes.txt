processing alphabets like chinese, hindi, etc.
- More info is available in unicode.org

- long int and long long can store larger integers.
- int can be of 2 bytes, 4 bytes.
- It depends on the bitsize of the machine i.e. ALU

- FLOAT ALWAYS TAKES 4 BYTES, CHAR ALWAYS TAKES 1 BYTES
- SIZE OF INT DEPENDS ON COMPILER.

- Float number is stored in IEEE 754 standard in every machine
- 17.26 is represented in 1726E-2

- Boolean: 

0 : FALSE
ANY OTHER NO: TRUE

- Void:- Used for defining null function and pointer

* sizeof() is used for learning the size of the datatype
* CHAR_MIN, INT_MIN, CHAR_MAX, INT_MAX is used for learning the range
