* Let us define class rectangle.

Class Rectangle
{

int length; // attributes
int breadth;

int area()
{
return length * breadth;
}

int perimeter()
{
return (2*length + 2*breadth)
}

}; // here semicolon is mandatory.

* Now how to use the class

int main()
{
rectangle r1, r2; // here r1 and r2 are objects.
}

// r1 and r2 are datatypes/ variables of datatype rectangles
// r1 and r2 will occupy memory in the stack
// so now r1 and r2 will take 4 bytes of memory in stack
// 2 bytes for length and 2 bytes for length
// class and function won't take any memory in stack.

* assigning values to the attributes of the objects

int main()
{
rectangle r1, r2; 

r1.length=10;
r1.breadth=5
// Now we can calculate area and other functions.
cout << r1.area();
r2.length = 15;
r2.breadth = 10;
cout << r2.area();
}

** // These length and breadth cannot be accessed by user because
by default it becomes PRIVATE.
** Hence we have to go back to the class and define 
everything explicitly as PUBLIC.

Class Rectangle
{
public:

int length; // attributes
int breadth;

int area()
{
return length * breadth;
}

int perimeter()
{
return (2*length + 2*breadth)
}

};
