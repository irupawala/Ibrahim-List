Clk and D are called Timing Arcs as the time from input to Q depends on them
Reset is alsi w.r.t clock hence it is called as recovery and removal arc
combionation circuit has direct arc from input to output

SS = RT - AT

AT_su = Tbuff_max + TCLK_Q_max + Tcomb_max = 2+11+5 = 18
AT_hold = Tbuff_min + TCLK_Q_min + Tcomb_min = 1+9+3 = 13

RT_su = Tbuff_min + Tperiod - Tsu = 2(1)+10-2 = 10
RT_hold = Tbuff_max + Thold = 2(2)+1 = 5

Setup Slack = -8
Hold Slack = 8

What is slew rate ?
