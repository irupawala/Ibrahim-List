Consider a class rectangle

class Rectangle
{

}

class cuboid: public rectangle
{

}


Class Table
{
Rectangle top;
int legs;

}

** Here cuboid is Inherited from rectangle hence cuboid IsA Rectangle
** Here Table is having object of rectangle class. Hence table class HasA Rectangle

** There are two ways a class can be used:

1. Class can be derived: IsA
2. Object of a class can be used: HasA

Now a class can be have 3 kinds of members.

1. private
2. protected
3. public

Now the topic of discussion is which members is accessible in base class, which is accessible in derived class and which are 
accessible upon object. This is called as Access Specifiers.
