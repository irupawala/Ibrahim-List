Array is a collection of similar data elements under one name, each element is accessible using its index
• Memory for array is allocated contagiously
• For-each loop is used for accessing array
• N-dimension arrays are supported by C++
• Two-Dimensional Arrays are sued for Matrices
• Array can be created in Stack or Heap Section of memory

- int A[5] = {1, 2, 3}
- float B[3] = {1.2, 3.4, 5.6}
- Char C[] = {'A', 'B', 'C'}

int main()
	{
		float A[] = {2.3f, 4.5f, 9, 8, 7};
		
		for (int x:A)
			cout << x << endl;
			
		return 0;
		
	}
	
	
int main()
	{
		char A[] = {'A', 66, 'C', 68};
		
		for (auto x:A)
		// for (int x:A)
			cout << x << endl;
			
		return 0;
		
	}

- Always notice that here the name of the array A, B, C never stores the value itself but the address of the array
- In C the operator a[b] = *(a+b) hence individual elements of array can be accessed as a[b], b[a], *(a+b)
