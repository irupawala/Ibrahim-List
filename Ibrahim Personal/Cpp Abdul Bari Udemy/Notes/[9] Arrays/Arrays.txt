• Memory for array is allocated contagiously
• For-each loop is used for accessing array
• N-dimension arrays are supported by C++
• Two-Dimensional Arrays are sued for Matrices
• Array can be created in Stack or Heap Section of memory

- int A[5] = {1, 2, 3}
- float B[3] = {1.2, 3.4, 5.6}
- Char C[] = {'A', 'B', 'C'}

int main()
	{
		float A[] = {2.3f, 4.5f, 9, 8, 7};
		
		for (int x:A)
			cout << x << endl;
			
		return 0;
		
	}
	
	
int main()
	{
		char A[] = {'A', 66, 'C', 68};
		
		for (auto x:A)
		// for (int x:A)
			cout << x << endl;
			
		return 0;
		
	}
