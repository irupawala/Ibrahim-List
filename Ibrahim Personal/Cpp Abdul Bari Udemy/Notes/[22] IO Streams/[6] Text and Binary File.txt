- When you open a text file in any program like notepad then the program first converts the binary 
numbers to ASCII codes and then displays the characters on screen

- To read the binary file in C++ you haveto use the mode ios::binary.
Also there are different functions like read() and write().

- Binary files are faster and takes less space then the text file
