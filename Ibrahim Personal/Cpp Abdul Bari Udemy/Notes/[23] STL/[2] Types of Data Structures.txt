- Arrays have fixed size.
- Instead of array we can have LinkedList. Here instead of having fixed size array we have collection of nodes
where each node can have values.
- Benefits of linkedlist is that size of linkedlist grows or reduce as and when numbers are added or deleted.
- Hence this will take the size depending on the elements hence the size is variable.

- New nodes can be added or deleted anywhere in the LinkedList. This is called singly linkedlist. It has 
one pointer and can only go in one direction.

- Similarly we have doubly linkedlist where every nodes have previous pointer too hence in Doubly LinkedList
you can go in both forward and reverse direction.

- Some other data structures are stack, lifo, queue, Deque, Priority Queue, Map, Set.

- C++ provides built-in libraries of classes for all the data structures called as STL.
