STL have:

1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Iterators

- Built-in Algorithms are there to manage containers
- Arrays linkedlist stack queue are containers. Containers contains collection of data.
- Iterators are used for iterating over collection of value.


- some built-in algorithms are: 
- search(), sort(), reverse(), binary_search(), concat(), copy(), union(), intersection(), merge(), heap()


1. Vector:

- Self-managed array. Dynamically manages the size of array.
- This can grow and reduce itself. If we create bigger array it will dynamically copy the array into
bigger size array and also it will copy to the smaller size array if we reduce the size.
- functions available are as follows: push_back(), pop_back(), insert(), remove(), size(), empty().

2. List:

- This is for Doubly linkedlist. It has a pointer for next node and previous node.
- It is a template class. It can have any objects like int, float, string, your own object, etc.
- It has all the functions of vector but also it has push_front(), push_back(), front(), back()

3. Forward_List:

- This is a singly linkedlist.
- If we know that we are going to access only in forward direction then avoid doubly as it takes more space
- same functions as lists.

4. Deque:

- Same as vector but double ended queue hence you can insert and delete from both the ends
- same set of function as list and forward_list
- In vector you cannot add/ delete elements from front side

5. priority_queue:

- For max heap data structures.
- In priority_queue always the largest element of the queue.
- When you insert how it are arranged that is not the concern of the programmer. But the arrangment 
of the elements will not be in order.
- Has the function like push(), pop(), empty(), size().

6. Stack:

- same as LIFO.
- same functions as priority_queue

7. Set:

- will only have unique elements.
- Order of the elemets will not be maintained.
- This is a unique set of values and values cannot be modified but only displayed

8. Multiset:

- Same as set but allows duplicate

9. Map: 

- Allowed for storing key: value pair
- Uses hash table
- uses unique key

10. MultiMap:

- Multiple keys are allowed but same key value pairs are not allowed.
