25-26 ==> Basic Design Concept
27-8 ==> RTL Integration, 1st Job Application, 7th Wajebaat
9-16 ==> Verilog, C++, Linux
17-28 ==> Revision, DSC, VLSI Design Revision

28 ==> could be, but lets hope not and also hope that some extra time is given for H1B
- 28 onwards Focus on getting as many interviews as possible


- How to implement tri-state buffer in verilog ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2HPjppH7Rs

3 output states - 0, 1, z, 
3 input states - input, control, output
in control out
0	0	z
1	0	z
0	1	0
1	1	1

To summarize tri-state buffer is a current valve which can shut off the output from specific components
the tri-state buffer allows us to select one output for many to send to a wire or bus
but we need to make absolutely certain that same wire do not transfer to same wire or bus

Demorgan's law = ~(A+B) = ~A.~B and ~(A.B) = ~A + ~B
Absorption law = A(A+C) = A and A + AC = A
Distributive law = A(B+C) = AB + AC and A + BC = (A+B)(A+C)
