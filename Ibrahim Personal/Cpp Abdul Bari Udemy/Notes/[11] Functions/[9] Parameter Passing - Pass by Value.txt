* What are the methods by which function can take parameters ?.

1. Pass by value
2. Pass by address
3. Pass by reference // not available in C language

***NOTE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE SAME FUNCTION ONE VALUE IS CALLED BY VALUE , OTHER BY CALL BY ADDRESS AND 
OTHER BY CALL BY REFERENCE

1. Pass by value

int swap (int a, int b) // formal parameters
{
int temp;
temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
}


int main()
{
int x =10, y=20; // actual parameters
swap(x,y);
cout << x << " " << y;
}

- The function swap and all the variables a and b gets deleted once the function is completed

- Here the value of x and y will still be the same but a and b will get swapped. 
- Hence call by value method cannot modify the actual parameters by the change in formal parameters.
- Call by value is used when you have the function which works on the parameters and RETURN the result.
- In our example the swap function is not returning anything hence call by value cannot be used for the
operations like swap.
