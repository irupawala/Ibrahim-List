Either we expand the window by appending a character to the right or we shift the entire window to the right by one. We only expand the window when the frequency of the newly added character exceeds the historical maximum frequency (from a previous window that included a valid substring).In other words, we do not need to know the exact maximum count of the current window. The only thing we need to know is whether the maximum count exceeds the historical maximum count, and that can only happen because of the newly added char.

Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - As we expect only the lower case letters in the input string, we can conclude that the space complexity will be O(26) to store each letterâ€™s frequency in the HashMap, which is asymptotically equal to O(1)
