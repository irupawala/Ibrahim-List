# [8.120] Short Circuit Evaluation

* Short circuit is the situation where the expression does not get evaluated from the second part of the expression when the result is clear from the first part alone.
* In the example below, if statement gets evaluated from the first part before && or || hence it never reaches the second part.

```java
package academy.learnprogramming;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a = 12;
        int b = 6;

//        if (b != 0) {
//            int c = divideTwoNumbers(a, b);
//
//            if (c == 2) {
//                System.out.println("We've found a 2.");
//            }
//        }

        if (b != 0 && divideTwoNumbers(a, b) == 2) {
            System.out.println("We've found a 2.");
        }

        if (b == 0 || divideTwoNumbers(a, b) == 2) {
            System.out.println("We've found a 2.");
        }

    }

    private static int divideTwoNumbers(int x, int y) {
        return x / y;
    }
}
