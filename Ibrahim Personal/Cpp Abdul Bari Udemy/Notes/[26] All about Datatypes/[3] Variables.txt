- Methods of assignment to a variable

int day=1;
int day(1);
int day=(0);
int day{0};
int day={0};

Literals: Type of values that can be assigned to a variable

int a = 10;
int a = 010; // This is octal number system
int a = 0x10; // This is hexadecimal number system

INT long literals are followed by L;

int dist = 65834L;

- To a float literal integer numbers can be assigned.

float a = 10;

* It is a good practice to follow a float literal by f;
because by default decimal numbers in C are double

float price = 12.5;
float cost = 1.52e4f;
double weight = 2.53e7L;

- DOUBLE float is followed by L;


** char section = 'A' // single quote is char
** char section = "A" // double quote is string
** char section = 65 // This is also A assigned to section

** Notice that sting is a CLASS and not a pre-defined datatype like int, float,etc
** Hence we can also use name string whenever we want
e.g: 

int string;
