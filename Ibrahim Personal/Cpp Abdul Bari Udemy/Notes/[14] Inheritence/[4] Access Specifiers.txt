* Data Hiding is one of the main features of OOP.

Access Specifiers
• Private - Accessible only inside a class
• Protected - Accessible inside a class and inside derived classes
• Public - accessible inside class, inside derived class and upon object



class Base:
{

private:
	int a;
	
protected;
	int b;
	
punblic:
	int c;

void funBase()
{

	a=10;
	b=20;
	c=30;
	}
};

class Derived: Base{
public:

	funDerived()
	{
	a=1;
	b=2;
	c=3;
	}
};

int main()
{

	Base x;
	x.a = 15;
	x.b = 30;
	x.c = 90;
	
}

** a (private) and b (protected) CANNOT be accessed but public object c CAN be accessed on object upon class
** Derived class can access the protected and public but not private
** Base class can access all its members private, protected and public
