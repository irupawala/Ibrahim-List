* **HBA (Host Bus Adapter)** -  host bus adapter (HBA) is a [circuit](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/circuit) board or integrated circuit adapter that connects a host system, such as a [server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server), to a [storage](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/storage) or [network](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network) device. An HBA also provides input/output ([I/O](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/input-output-I-O)) processing to reduce the load on the host's [microprocessor](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/microprocessor-logic-chip) when storing and retrieving data, helping to improve the host's overall [performance](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/performance).
* **Direct memory access** (**DMA**) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage) ([random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)) independently of the [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU).
