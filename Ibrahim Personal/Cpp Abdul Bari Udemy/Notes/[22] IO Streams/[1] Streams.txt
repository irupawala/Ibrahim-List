- Stream is a flow of data or flow of character.
- Streams are used for accessing the data from outside the program like external sources to destination
- E.g. program accesses to keyboard, monitor, file, Network
- For input/ output stream there is buildin class available called iostream. From this the classes are 
coming out like istream and ostream.
- For file access there are classes like ifstream(input file stream) and ofstream
- cin and cout are objects of istream and ostream respectively.
- Also we can OVERLOAD insertion and extraction operator (<< and >>).
- We can use same insertion and extraction operator to access file in c++
