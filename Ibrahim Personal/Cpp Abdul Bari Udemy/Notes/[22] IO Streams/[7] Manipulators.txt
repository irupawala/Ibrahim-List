- Manipulators are used for manipulating or formatting streams.

E.g:

- cout << endl; can also be writtens as cout << "\n";

- similarly we can also use the manipulators for int like hex, oct, dec

e.g. cout << hex << 163 // hence A3 will be displayed

- We also have manipulators for float like fixed and scientific

There are other manipulators also like set() (sets some amount of space for displaying data)

e.g. cout << set(10) << "Hello" This reserves 10 spaces for hello even though it is only 4 alphabets long

There are also other manipulators like left, right, ws, etc. left and right are shift left and right

- ws is for white space

e.g:

cout << 10 << ws << 20; // 10 and 20 are shown with a space
