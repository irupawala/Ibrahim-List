- The class which has pure virtual function is called as abstract class.

** The object of this abstract class cannot be created only POINTERS of this abstract class can be created.
** Hence the purpose of the abstract class is just to achieve POLYMORPHISM.

Based on the types of the functions the classes are bifurcated in to three types:

1. Base class having only concrete functions which are used only for Inheritence.
2. Base class having some concrete functions + pure virtual functions. These are used for reusability + polymorphism.
3. Base class having only pure virtual functions. These are used only to achieve polymorphism and are called INTERFACE
