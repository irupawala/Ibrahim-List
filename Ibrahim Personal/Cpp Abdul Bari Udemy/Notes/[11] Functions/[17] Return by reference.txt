* Return by reference

Ex:

int & fun(int &a) --> call by reference (int &a) and return by reference & fun
{
cout << a;
return a; // here reference of x is returned which is x only. hence the fun(x) is equal to x
}

main()
{
int x=10;
//y = fun(x); // we always take return result of a function in a variable in call by value. 
// function always comes on the right side of the assignment.

//fun(x); // here now fun(x) = x only, as reference to a is x
fun(x) = 25;  //hence now function is written on the LEFT SIDE and FUNCTION IS acting as a reference of variable x

cout << x;
}

// Here a and x are the value at the same memory location
