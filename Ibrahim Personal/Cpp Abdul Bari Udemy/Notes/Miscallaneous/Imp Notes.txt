* AUTO Datatype:

- One more benefit for using for each loop is AUTO datatype
- If we don't know the datatype of the elements in array we can write AUTO datatype in for each		

for (auto x: A) // This will automatically make the datatype of x as the datatype available in the array.
	{
		cout << x << endl;
		}
		
* INT_MIN and INT_MAX:

- If we write min = INT_MIN then the smallest integer of the program will be assigned to min
